            "Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica) originated in South America and were a staple in the diets of ancient Mayans and Aztecs. They are extremely high in Omega 3 and are loaded with antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They can be eaten right out of the bag, sprinkled on hot cereal and used in baking, for a nutritional boost comparable only to flaxseed in Omega 3 and dietary fiber content. \n",

            "Chia seed is an ancient Mayan staple obtained from the Mexican native chia plant or Salvia hispanica, named after the Mayan word “strength.” This modern super food was aptly named since the seeds were known by several indigenous peoples to promote endurance. In fact, chia seed was often the only source of nutrition consumed by the ancient Aztecs and southwestern tribes of the U.S. while traveling great distances.\n",
            "Nutritionally speaking, chia seeds pack a wallop. It consists of about 30% protein, and an abundance of vitamins A, B, D, E and K as well as alpha-linolenic and linoleic acid, which are essential fatty acids the body cannot manufacture on its own. In addition to containing calcium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, silicon, sodium, sulfur, thiamine, and zinc, chia seed is the richest plant-based source of omega-3. It is also an excellence source of soluble fiber, and a mere quarter cup of chia seeds supplies as much calcium as three cups of milk, as much magnesium as ten stalks of broccoli, 30% more antioxidants than blueberries, and 25% more dietary fiber than flaxseed.\n",
            "The seeds have a mild nutty flavor and can be enjoyed on salads, cereal, yogurt, or ground-up and baked into wholesome breads and muffins. However, soaking the chia seeds is the most common way to eat them. They can absorb a large amount of liquid in a rapid amount of time, between 10 and 12 times their volume in under 8 minutes. Just add the chia seed gel to smoothies. Mix it up with salad dressings, puddings, or granola, or simply take it by the spoonful.\n",
            "To make a basic chia gel, simply add 1/3 cup of seeds or 2 oz. to 2 cups of water. Stir the mixture well and then leave it in your refrigerator in a sealed jar. This will yield around 17 oz. of chia gel. You can begin to eat the gel almost immediately if you like. Just nine minutes is enough time for the gel to be formed. Allowing the chia seeds to sit for even longer, such as a few hours, will allow even more of the nutrients to be accessible. So many people like to make up a batch like this and leave it in the fridge. It will stay good for about three weeks. Then you can just reach into the fridge and take out some of the ready-made gel whenever you need it.\n",
            "Chia will absorb anything, so you don’t just have to soak it in water. We like soaking it in things like apple juice, for example. That way, the intense sweetness of the apple juice is also offset by the chia and its great taste. We also often blend fruits such as bananas or persimmons then stir the chia into that mixture. Again, the longer the seeds are left to soak, the more their nutrients will be readily available to you. Still, you can easily eat a meal like this, 10 minutes or less after preparing it.\n",

If the name sounds familiar, it might be because you once\\nnurtured a Chia Pet, a novelty item that involves sprouting chia seed\\nthrough a terra cotta container shaped like an animal. The tiny seeds\\nhave gained notoriety in recent years as a “super food,” although it was\\nused by the ancient Aztecs and Mayans of South America to sustain them\\nwhile traveling long distances with little provisions. In fact, “chia”\\nis the Mayan word for “strength.”\\nClicking \\\"learn more\\\" next to each variety will take you to individual\\nproduct pages for details.\\n01.\\nA Bit of Botany\\na little botanical information about chia\\ndescription\\nChia is an annual herb in the Lamiaceae or mint family growing up to 1 m\\n(3.3 ft) tall, with opposite leaves that are 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) long and\\n3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) wide. Its flowers are purple or white and are produced\\nin numerous clusters in a spike at the end of each stem. It is in flower\\nfrom Jul to August. The flowers are hermaphroditic. Chia is hardy from USDA\\nZones 9-12. Many plants cultivated as S. hispanica are actually S.\\nlavandulifolia.\\nChia seeds are typically small ovals with a diameter of\\nabout 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black and\\nwhite.\\ncommon names & nomenclature\\nThe word chia is derived from the Nahuatl word chian, meaning \\\"oily\\\".\\nAlso known as:\\nchia, chia seeds, salba seeds, sabja seeds or salvia hispanica\\n02.\\nWhere in the World\\nhabitat and range for chia\\nhabitat and range for chia\\nChia is native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. Chia thrives best in warm climates and has been successful in even southern parts of North America. The rising popularity of chia seeds has expanded the plant’s domain, now grown outside of Mexico and Guatemala in places like the southeastern United States and other parts of South America. The plant’s scientific name, Salvia hispanica, is a member of the mint family. \\n03.\\nCultivation & Harvesting\\nconsiderations for growing and harvesting chia\\nclimate\\nChia grows best in a warm sunny location.\\nsoil\\nChia prefers a light to medium well-drained fertile soil.\\ngrowing\\nSow chia seeds in March/April in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place\\nwithin 2 weeks. Transplant out the seedlings into individual pots when they\\nare large enough to handle and plant out in late spring or early summer. The\\nseed can also be sown directly in the ground during April/May, though this\\nsowing might not mature its seed in a cool summer.\\nharvesting\\nBegin harvesting your chia flowers as soon as most of the petals have\\nfallen. Give them time to dry in paper bags or on a drying rack, but prepare\\nfor at least some of the chia seeds to break free in the process. Do not\\nhang the plants upside down in your shed. Once the flowers are dry, crumple\\nthem in your hands over a sieve or bowl to loosen the seeds, separate out\\nthe seeds from the other plant parts.\\npreserving\\nStore chia seeds Store your bulk chia seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.\\n04.\\nThe Rest of the Story\\nadditional information\\nChia seed is obtained from the Mexican native chia plant (Salvia hispanica),\\nso named after the Mayan word meaning “strength.” It would seem that the\\nplant was aptly named since the seeds were known by several indigenous\\npeoples to promote endurance.

If the name sounds familiar, it might be because you once\\nnurtured a Chia Pet, a novelty item that involves sprouting chia seed\\nthrough a terra cotta container shaped like an animal. The tiny seeds\\nhave gained notoriety in recent years as a “super food,” although it was\\nused by the ancient Aztecs and Mayans of South America to sustain them\\nwhile traveling long distances with little provisions. In fact, “chia”\\nis the Mayan word for “strength.”\\nClicking \\\"learn more\\\" next to each variety will take you to individual\\nproduct pages for details.\\n01.\\nA Bit of Botany\\na little botanical information about chia\\ndescription\\nChia is an annual herb in the Lamiaceae or mint family growing up to 1 m\\n(3.3 ft) tall, with opposite leaves that are 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) long and\\n3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) wide. Its flowers are purple or white and are produced\\nin numerous clusters in a spike at the end of each stem. It is in flower\\nfrom Jul to August. The flowers are hermaphroditic. Chia is hardy from USDA\\nZones 9-12. Many plants cultivated as S. hispanica are actually S.\\nlavandulifolia.\\nChia seeds are typically small ovals with a diameter of\\nabout 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black and\\nwhite.\\ncommon names & nomenclature\\nThe word chia is derived from the Nahuatl word chian, meaning \\\"oily\\\".\\nAlso known as:\\nchia, chia seeds, salba seeds, sabja seeds or salvia hispanica\\n02.\\nWhere in the World\\nhabitat and range for chia\\nhabitat and range for chia\\nChia is native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. Chia thrives best in warm climates and has been successful in even southern parts of North America. The rising popularity of chia seeds has expanded the plant’s domain, now grown outside of Mexico and Guatemala in places like the southeastern United States and other parts of South America. The plant’s scientific name, Salvia hispanica, is a member of the mint family. \\n03.\\nCultivation & Harvesting\\nconsiderations for growing and harvesting chia\\nclimate\\nChia grows best in a warm sunny location.\\nsoil\\nChia prefers a light to medium well-drained fertile soil.\\ngrowing\\nSow chia seeds in March/April in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place\\nwithin 2 weeks. Transplant out the seedlings into individual pots when they\\nare large enough to handle and plant out in late spring or early summer. The\\nseed can also be sown directly in the ground during April/May, though this\\nsowing might not mature its seed in a cool summer.\\nharvesting\\nBegin harvesting your chia flowers as soon as most of the petals have\\nfallen. Give them time to dry in paper bags or on a drying rack, but prepare\\nfor at least some of the chia seeds to break free in the process. Do not\\nhang the plants upside down in your shed. Once the flowers are dry, crumple\\nthem in your hands over a sieve or bowl to loosen the seeds, separate out\\nthe seeds from the other plant parts.\\npreserving\\nStore chia seeds Store your bulk chia seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.\\n04.\\nThe Rest of the Story\\nadditional information\\nChia seed is obtained from the Mexican native chia plant (Salvia hispanica),\\nso named after the Mayan word meaning “strength.” It would seem that the\\nplant was aptly named since the seeds were known by several indigenous\\npeoples to promote endurance. In fact, chia seed was often the only source\\nof nutrition consumed by the ancient Aztecs and southwestern tribes of the\\nU.S. while traveling great distances in pursuit of conquest or trade. This\\ntradition does not appear to have been lost since many athletes regularly\\npartake of chia seed to help increase stamina and performance today.\\nNutritionally speaking, chia seed packs a wallop. Aside from consisting of\\nabout 30% protein, chia seed delivers an abundance of vitamins A, B, D, E\\nand K. They also contain alpha-linolenic and linoleic acid, essential fatty\\nacids that the body cannot manufacture on its own. In terms of other\\nnutrients and minerals, the list is lengthy. A run down by alphabetical\\norder: calcium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin,\\nphosphorus, potassium, silicon, sodium, sulfur, thiamine, and zinc. Finally,\\nchia seed is the richest plant-based source of omega-3 available.\\nChia seed is also an excellence source of soluble fiber. In fact, due to its\\nhydrophilic properties it can absorb up to 12 times its volume in water.\\nThis activity has two benefits. First, it helps to keep the body hydrated,\\nwhich is important for proper cellular metabolism and renewal. Secondly, it\\nreduces transit time in the gastrointestinal tract while enhancing the\\nabsorption of vitamins and minerals.\\nThe hydrophilic properties of chia seed also permit the formation of\\nhydrophilic colloids, a mucilaginous substance similar in appearance to\\ngelatin. This is the same benefit obtained from eating raw vegetables versus\\ncooked, only it’s not necessary to swallow a bunch of chia seeds in order\\nfor this event take place. As you’ll learn in a moment, all that’s needed is\\na container of water.\\nweight loss\\nThe mechanism behind chia seed's ability to act as a weight loss aid is\\nquite simple. In short, its extraordinary ability to absorb water translates\\nto displacing fat and calories when added to foods. The ideal ratio for this\\nconversion is 9:1, or nine parts liquid to one part chia seed. Here’s an\\nexperiment to try:\\nScience is fun but, in this case, you can eat your experiment. In fact,\\nyou’ve just made a delicacy known to Mexican natives as chia fresca. If you\\nadd three to four tablespoons of this substance to non-baked foods at least\\nthree times a day, you’ll be adding significant bulk to your diet (read that\\nas appetite suppressant) and replacing fat and calories with a material\\nconsisting of 90% water. Chia gel can be made with juice in place of the\\nwater, and added to sauces, cereals, jams, puddings, yogurt, or smoothies.\\nIt can also be prepared in an 8:1 ratio and added to baked goods in place of\\noil. Kept refrigerated, the gel will keep fresh for about three weeks.\\nWhat does hydrophilic colloid of chia seed taste like? Fear not. The seeds\\nimpart a very mild nutty flavor that won’t overpower other foods. However,\\nif you prefer, you can simply forego chia gel and eat up to four tablespoons\\nof the seeds instead. For that matter, chia seed are delicious toasted. The\\nseeds can also be sprouted for a tasty and nutritious addition to sandwiches.\\nregulate blood sugar\\nThe same hydrophilic properties that permit chia seed to encourage weight\\nloss may also responsible for contributing to the regulation of serum\\nglucose levels. That is, the same gel-forming process described above also\\ntakes place in the stomach and helps to block the conversion of\\ncarbohydrates to sugars. In fact, Canadian researchers have recently found\\nthat regular consumption of chia seed reduced blood sugar levels in patients\\nwith type II diabetes.\\nThere are other attributes of chia seed that are suspected of causing this\\neffect, too.

            "The people of the ancient Aztec and Mayan empires revered chia seeds as vital nourishment. These mighty, gluten-free seeds are packed with Omega-3, protein, rare antioxidants and fiber. We offer our Organic Chia Seeds in whole black and ground varieties.\n",
            "Store in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Refrigerate ground chia seeds after opening.\n",
            "Tiny seeds that pack a big nutritional punch\n",
            "A traditional South American crop, chia seed (Latin name Salvia hispanica L.) has been used for thousands of years. These small, crunchy, gluten-free seeds are a rich source of protein, beneficial antioxidants, Omega-3 and fiber. A 3 tbsp. serving of chia has 15x more magnesium than broccoli, 30% more antioxidants than blueberries and 2x more potassium than bananas. Add Nutiva Organic Chia Seed to yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, baked goods, or use them as a vegan replacement for eggs in baking recipes.\n",
            "Fight Climate Change\n",
            "Working with PUR Project, we offset carbon emissions from our chia farming and production by purchasing 1,419 trees from the Alto Huayabamba Agroforestry Project in Peru.This will sequester carbon from the atmosphere, preserve biodiversity, conserve water and protect against natural disasters.\n",

            "What’s the difference between Nutiva Organic Black Chia Seed and Organic White Chia Seed? \n",
            "Their main difference is the color! Some people prefer the white seeds for certain recipes in which the presence of black seeds would be undesirable. They can be used interchangeably. \n",
            "Do I need to pre-soak Nutiva Organic Chia Seed?\n",
            "Chia seeds do not need to be soaked prior to eating them. However, chia absorbs 9-12 times its weight in water and can be used to make a delicious tapioca-like pudding.\n",
            "Where does the chia in Nutiva Organic Chia Seed come from?\n",
            "We source our chia seeds from several countries in South America, Central America and Mexico. We stamp the country of origin for each product on its bag. \n",

Chia seeds have grown popular in American vegan cooking and are a traditional topping for yogurt or pudding.\n",

With that search the Nutstop products came up and it turned out to be a great deal. We actually ordered the 25lb quantity and received the best price and shared them read more... around with family and friends. It also introduced us to other great products (the dried fruit is awesome) that we are now reordering from Nutstop. Everything we have order so far has been great quality and the price is comparable or less than any other seller. We look forward to trying many other products from the great variety Nutstop offer!! Thank you Nutstop! ckopras , Bruce, WI 04/17/2024 Rated 5 out of 5 5 Nutstop is our nut stop for buying fresh quality nuts. Quick shipping and quality customer service. Try Nutstop for your next nut stop! Wallace Boulden , LOVELAND, CO 03/03/2024 Rated 5 out of 5 5 I tried these for the first time in a recent order and am very impressed -- both by their taste and their freshness. I've purchased them from the store before and they always seem to have gone slightly rancid, but not so with Nutstop's. I've been adding them to read more... yogurt-and-fruit bowls, smoothies, and oatmeal. They add a nice texture and taste. RubyWilla23 , Cambridge, MA 08/13/2022 Rated 5 out of 5 5 I started using chia seeds about a year ago, incorporating it into my daily health regimen. I actually love them in juice or a glass of water. They are fun to drink as they expand and are very nutritious. I decided to order nutstop's chia seeds and I was read more... not disappointed.

They arrived quickly and securely boxed, and the quality of the seeds is good. They are clean and smell fresh and we are happy with the seeds we have read more... used so far. My only preference would be to have a bit of a heavier internal package; we have always gotten them delivered in several 4# heavy zip top bags from other vendors and this plastic bag just felt a little flimsy for 25 pounds of weight but since it was intact when it arrived, I will not complain! I have recommended this source to another family member who also uses chia seeds.

I used it once, closed the bag (or so I thought), put it in a box with all other seeds. The box fell off the shelf with the entire chia spilling. Other seeds remained intact.
